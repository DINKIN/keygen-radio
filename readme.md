# Keygen Radio

Listen endlessly to keygen chiptunes in JS. This is the source code for [Keygen
Radio][kgradio].

## Development

To make it work, you need some chiptunes. If you don't have a dir called
`./tunes` (the default) the `./do` script below will get some from
[keygenmusic.org][kgmusic]

Build everything with:

    npm install
    npm run build

Everything that's required will be built in `./dist`. Start a static server that
will serve it with:

    npm start

## Acknowledgements

This uses [chiplib][chiplib], my fork of Simon GÃ¼ndling's
[chiptune2][chiptune2]. It uses Emscripten to transpile [libopenmpt][libopenmpt]
into JavaScript.

## TODO

- Add a modal for more info on the homepage.
